## ✨ Why This Template?

Most portfolio templates are just HTML/CSS. **This one is different.**
This template is built by a QA, for QAs. It comes pre-packaged with a complete **Cypress E2E Testing Framework**.

*   ✅ **Showcase Your Automation Skills**: The repository proves you can write clean, maintainable test code with **Page Object Models**.
*   ✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Integrated with **GitHub Actions** (Artifacts & Reporting). Every change runs the test suite automatically.
*   ✅ **Custom Commands**: Encapsulated logic for resilient testing.
*   ✅ **Interactive OS Design**: Complete with Terminal, Finder, and VS Code-style windows.
*   ✅ **Easy to Customize**: No complex coding required. Just edit the content files.

## 🛠️ How to Use (For Non-Programmers)

You don't need to be a Fullstack Developer to use this. Just follow these steps:

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
npm install
```

### 2. Customize Content
You only need to edit **2 files** to make this website yours:

#### 🟢 **Edit Profile, Experience & Education**
Open `index.html`. Search for these sections and replace the text with yours:
*   `<h1>YOUR NAME</h1>` (Hero Section)
*   `href="mailto:..."` (Contact Info)
*   `href="https://wa.me/..."` (WhatsApp)
*   `<section id="experience">` (Update your job history)
*   `<section id="education">` (Update your degrees/bootcamps)

#### 🟢 **Edit Projects Data**
Open `src/main.js`. You will find a `const projects = [...]` list.
Just change the values inside the quotes:
```javascript
{
  title: 'My Awesome Automation Project',
  description: 'I automated 100+ test cases using Selenium...',
  github: 'https://github.com/yourusername/project',
  tags: ['Selenium', 'Java', 'TestNG']
}
```

#### 🟢 **Update Profile Photo**
1.  Prepare your photo (square aspect ratio recommended).
2.  Rename it to `profile.jpg`.
3.  Replace the existing file at `public/images/profile.jpg`.

#### 🟢 **Update Cover Letter**
1.  Prepare your Cover Letter/CV in PDF format.
2.  Rename it to `Cover_Letter.pdf`.
3.  Replace the existing file at `public/files/Cover_Letter.pdf`.
4.  Update the link in `index.html` to point to your new file if you changed the name.

### 3. Deploy 🚀
Push your changes to GitHub, and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
1.  Run the tests to ensure you didn't break anything.
2.  Deploy your new portfolio to GitHub Pages (after you configure Settings > Pages > Source to `gh-pages` branch).
